## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Products section renders below the flipbook

The WhiteHawk page SHALL render a products section below the flipbook (`WhiteHawkCaseStudy`) and
above `CaseStudyNav`. The section SHALL display exactly five product entries sourced from `PRODUCTS`
in `src/content/products.ts`. The first three SHALL be named `Cyber Risk Rating`,
`Cyber Risk Portfolio`, and `Compliance Frameworks`.

#### Scenario: Products section is present in document flow

- **WHEN** a visitor loads `/portfolio/whitehawk`
- **THEN** a grid of five product entries is visible below the flipbook content

#### Scenario: Each entry shows a name and thumbnail area

- **WHEN** the products section is rendered
- **THEN** each of the five entries shows the product name and a thumbnail area (image or
  placeholder rectangle)

### Requirement: Product entries link to individual product pages

Each product entry SHALL link to `/portfolio/whitehawk/<id>` via `TransitionLink` (or `AppLink`)
so the water-fill transition fires on navigation. The first three entries' `id` values SHALL be
`cyber-risk-rating`, `cyber-risk-portfolio`, and `compliance-frameworks`.

#### Scenario: Clicking a product entry navigates with transition

- **WHEN** a visitor clicks a product entry
- **THEN** the water-fill page transition fires and the visitor is taken to
  `/portfolio/whitehawk/<id>`

#### Scenario: Cyber Risk Rating entry targets its chapter

- **WHEN** a visitor clicks the Cyber Risk Rating entry
- **THEN** they are taken to `/portfolio/whitehawk/cyber-risk-rating`

#### Scenario: Cyber Risk Portfolio entry targets its chapter

- **WHEN** a visitor clicks the Cyber Risk Portfolio entry
- **THEN** they are taken to `/portfolio/whitehawk/cyber-risk-portfolio`

#### Scenario: Compliance Frameworks entry targets its chapter

- **WHEN** a visitor clicks the Compliance Frameworks entry
- **THEN** they are taken to `/portfolio/whitehawk/compliance-frameworks`

#### Scenario: Middle-click or right-click opens the URL directly

- **WHEN** a visitor middle-clicks or right-clicks a product entry
- **THEN** the browser opens `/portfolio/whitehawk/<id>` in a new tab without triggering the
  water-fill transition

### Requirement: Thumbnail placeholder is trivially swappable

A product entry with `thumbnail: null` SHALL render a styled placeholder rectangle. Setting
`thumbnail` to a non-null imported asset SHALL render that image with identical dimensions. The three
shipped chapters SHALL use `cyber-risk-scorecard_thumbnail.png`, `portfolio_report-thumbnail.png`,
and `frameworks_thumbnail.png`; the remaining two entries stay `null` until their chapters ship.

#### Scenario: Null thumbnail renders a placeholder

- **WHEN** a product's `thumbnail` field is `null`
- **THEN** the entry renders a grey/muted rectangle in place of the image

#### Scenario: Non-null thumbnail renders the image

- **WHEN** a product's `thumbnail` field is a non-null imported asset
- **THEN** the entry renders an `<img>` with `src` set to that asset

#### Scenario: Shipped chapters show their real thumbnails

- **WHEN** a visitor loads `/portfolio/whitehawk`
- **THEN** the first three entries show their own thumbnails and the remaining two show placeholders,
  all at the same size
